### Welcome :+1:_<big>`Fork and Star`</big>_:+1:, then we'll let you know when we update

```bash
#### News:
#### 2021.5.22: ---->AMFMN is expected to be released after the RSITMD open to access.<----
#### 2021.7.29: ---->The code of AMFMN is expected to be released before September<----
#### 2021.8.03: ---->The code of AMFMN has been open to access<----

```bash
Installation

We recommended the following dependencies:
Python 3
PyTorch > 0.3
Numpy
h5py
nltk
yaml
```

```bash

Note:
1. In order to facilitate reproduction, we have provided processed annotations.
2. We prepare some used file::
  (1)[seq2vec (Password:NIST)]([https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jz61ZYs8NZflhU_Mm4PbaQ](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FOPldSGO6ctETiXMlPGC8g))
  (2)[RSICD images (Password:NIST)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lH5m047P9m2IvoZMPsoDsQ)
3. We found that the split method of the UCM and Sydney datasets has a greater impact on performance due to their small size, so we no longer provide performance support for the above two datasets.
```

```bash
Run: (We take the dataset RSITMD as an example)
Step1:
    Put the images of different datasets in ./data/{dataset}_precomp/images/

    --data
        --rsitmd_precomp
        -- train_caps.txt     # train anns
        -- train_filename.txt # corresponding imgs
        -- test_caps.txt      # test anns
        -- test_filename.txt  # corresponding imgs
        -- images             # images here
            --img1.jpg
            --img2.jpg
            ...

Step2:
    Modify the corresponding yaml in ./options.

    Regard RSITMD_AMFMN.yaml as opt, which you need to change is:
        opt['dataset']['data_path']  # change to precomp path
        opt['dataset']['image_path']  # change to image path
        opt['model']['seq2vec']['dir_st'] # some files about seq2vec

Step3:
    Bash the ./sh in ./exec.
    Note the GPU define in specific .sh file.

    cd exec
    bash run_amfmn_rsitmd.sh

Note: We use k-fold verity to do a fair compare. Other details please see the code itself.
